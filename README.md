## v4.4.14
### Updated on 2025-July-11

## About
spdMerlin is an internet speedtest and monitoring tool for AsusWRT Merlin with charts for daily, weekly and monthly summaries. It tracks download/upload bandwidth as well as latency, jitter and packet loss.

spdMerlin is free to use under the [GNU General Public License version 3](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0) (GPL 3.0).

spdMerlin uses [Speedtest CLI](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli) and includes the required licenses, which must be accepted on install of spdMerlin.
As of spdMerlin v4.4.0 the Asus built-in Ookla speedtest binary is used to run the speedtests.

A swap file is required, you can set one up easily by using amtm, which is built into the router.

This script began as a user-friendly installer for a personal project developed by [JGrana](https://www.snbforums.com/members/jgrana.20663/)

## Supported firmware versions
You must be running firmware Merlin 384.15/384.13_4 or Fork 43E5 (or later) [Asuswrt-Merlin](https://asuswrt.lostrealm.ca/)
