## v4.4.6
### Updated on 2024-July-04
## About
spdMerlin is an internet speedtest and monitoring tool for AsusWRT Merlin with charts for daily, weekly and monthly summaries. It tracks download/upload bandwidth as well as latency, jitter and packet loss.

spdMerlin is free to use under the [GNU General Public License version 3](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0) (GPL 3.0).

spdMerlin uses [Speedtest CLI](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli) and includes the required licenses, which must be accepted on install of spdMerlin.
As of spdMerlin v4.4.0 the Asus built-in Ookla speedtest binary is used to run the speedtests.

A swap file is required, you can set one up easily by using amtm, which is built into the router.

This script began as a user-friendly installer for a personal project developed by [JGrana](https://www.snbforums.com/members/jgrana.20663/)

Installs and updates for this addon are redirected via the [Scarf Gateway](https://about.scarf.sh/scarf-gateway) by [Scarf](https://about.scarf.sh/about). This allows me to gather data on the number of new installations of my addons, how often users check for updates and more. This is purely for my use to actually see some usage data from my addons so that I can see the value provided by my continued work. It does not mean I am going to start charging to use my addons.
